## About The Project

The main purpose of this project is to design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of accurately classifying MRI scan images to determine the presence or absence of a tumor. Through extensive training on a mixture of two separate datasets (over 800 images each, for both tumor and non-tumor classification) the resulting model achieves an accuracy rate of above 90% every time.




## Built With

- Python
- Python Libraries, such as PyTorch, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Installation




## Usage

After the successfull installation you can simply run all the cells in the `notebook.ipynb` file.

With the help of the bottom two cells you can have the finished model make a prediction for your own MRI brain scans. Please have a look at the accompaning instructions inside the notebook.
